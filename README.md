# PYDOJO
![](https://alessandronorfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/logo.png?w=150&h=143)

A playful way to learn coding with Python, based on Pygame.

# GETTING STARTED
## Setup
### With Thonny
- Install Thonny (https://thonny.org/)
- Thonny it's an IDE with an integrated Python3 distribution, so you don't need to install Python3
- Go to "Tools -> Manage Packages"
- Search and install "Pygame" and "Pydojo"

### Without Thonny
- Install Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Open a terminal emulator (or command prompt)
- Execute the following commands (preceeded by "sudo" if on LINUX or MAC)
  - Install Pygame: "pip install pygame"
  - Install Pydojo: "pip install pydojo"
- Find a suitable IDE. I suggest
  - Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  
## First steps
Now that you have installed the Python interpreter and the necessary libraries, you can start playing with Pydojo.
To do it, simply create a .py new empty file (example: [myfirstgame.py](https://github.com/sprintingkiwi/PYDOJO/wiki/myfirstgame.py)) and open it with your IDE.
